## Repository Name: python-datastructures-algorithms

### Description:

This repository contains implementations and explanations of various data structures and algorithms in Python. It is designed for students, developers, and anyone interested in improving their understanding and skills in computer science fundamentals.

### Features:

- **Data Structures**:
  - Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)
  - Stacks and Queues
  - Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, etc.)
  - Graphs (Adjacency List, Adjacency Matrix, etc.)
  - Heaps and Priority Queues
  - Hash Tables
  - Tries

- **Algorithms**:
  - Sorting (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.)
  - Searching (Linear Search, Binary Search, Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, etc.)
  - Dynamic Programming (Knapsack Problem, Longest Common Subsequence, etc.)
  - Greedy Algorithms
  - Divide and Conquer
  - Backtracking
  - Graph Algorithms (Dijkstra's, Kruskal's, Prim's, etc.)

### Goals:

- Provide clear and concise implementations of data structures and algorithms.
- Include detailed explanations and comments within the code to enhance understanding.
- Offer practical examples and use cases for each data structure and algorithm.
- Facilitate learning through well-organized and easy-to-navigate content.

### Contributions:

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to add new data structures, algorithms, optimizations, or corrections, please feel free to submit a pull request.
